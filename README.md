## What This Skill Suite Does

CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, IaC, monitoring and incident response.

This collection provides **10 specialised commands** and
**5 multi-step workflows**, all with a consistent
structured-output UI so you always know exactly where you are and what to do next.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/pipeline-generate` | Generate GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Jenkins pipeline from repo analysis |
| `/docker-optimize` | Multi-stage Dockerfile optimisation for image size and build cache efficiency |
| `/k8s-manifest` | Production-ready Kubernetes manifests with HPA, PDB and NetworkPolicies |
| `/terraform-scaffold` | Terraform module scaffold with variables, outputs and state backend config |
| `/monitor-setup` | Prometheus + Grafana alerting rules from SLO definitions |
| `/incident-runbook` | Auto-generated incident runbook from service topology and past incidents |
| `/cost-optimize` | Cloud cost anomaly detection and right-sizing recommendations |
| `/security-scan` | Container image, IaC and dependency vulnerability scan with CVSS triage |
| `/secrets-audit` | Detect hardcoded secrets, rotate recommendations and vault migration plan |
| `/rollback-plan` | Deployment rollback plan with canary thresholds and feature-flag kill switches |

**Usage:**
```bash
/pipeline-generate <target>
/docker-optimize --scope full --output md
```

---

## Workflows (Multi-step)

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `release-pipeline` | Full GitOps release: tag → build → scan → stage → promote → monitor |
| `disaster-recovery` | DR drill: failover, RTO/RPO validation and runbook update workflow |
| `infra-migration` | Lift-and-shift to cloud-native: assessment → IaC → cut-over checklist |
| `sre-onboarding` | New service onboarding: SLOs, dashboards, runbooks and on-call rotation |
| `devsecops-pipeline` | Shift-left security: SAST, DAST, SCA and policy-as-code gate workflow |

**Usage:**
```bash
/workflows:release-pipeline <target> --scope full
```

## UI Design

All commands display structured output with:

- **Progress panels** — real-time step tracking
- **Findings tables** — sorted by severity (🔴🟠🟡🟢)
- **Action checklists** — quick wins → medium-term → strategic
- **Summary cards** — at-a-glance metrics after each command


## Progress Display Example

## Interaction Pattern

Every command follows this 5-step structure:

```
① Scope Confirmation  — verify target and options with user
② Live Analysis       — progress bar while working
③ Findings Table      — structured results sorted by impact
④ Action Plan         — prioritised, time-boxed recommendations
⑤ Next Steps          — suggested follow-up commands
```

## Source Repository

This suite is derived from
**[wshobson/commands](https://github.com/wshobson/commands)**
which focuses on: _57 production slash commands: 15 workflows, 42 tools_.

Improvements in this adaptation:
- Domain-specific command vocabulary for DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure
- Enhanced structured output with visual progress tracking
- Prioritised action plans with time estimates
- Workflow orchestration for end-to-end processes
- Consistent UI conventions across all commands
